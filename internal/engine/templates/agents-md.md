## Mainline

<!-- mainline-agents-md-version: 6 -->

This project uses **Mainline** to record the intent behind every AI-driven
change and to surface conflicts between intents before they reach a PR
review. The agent is expected to both **read** team intents (for context)
and **write** its own intent (for the work it's doing). Both halves
matter — intents capture *why* changes were made, which is information
the diff alone cannot give you.

> **v0.3 invariant**: every commit on `main` is in exactly one of three
> states — `covered` (sealed intent claims it), `skipped` (`Mainline-Skip:`
> trailer or matched config pattern), or `uncovered` (neither). Run
> `mainline status` to see the rollup; `mainline gaps` to see uncovered
> commits with rescue suggestions.

### At the start of a task

```
mainline status --json
```

If there is no `active_intent`, start one (use the user's goal verbatim
when possible — it becomes the headline in `mainline log`):

```
mainline start "<short description of the user's goal>" --json
```

### Read team intents for context (do this aggressively)

Before working on anything non-trivial, scan recent intents for prior
work in the area you're about to touch. Each intent's `summary`
(what / why / decisions / risks / followups) plus `fingerprint`
(subsystems, files_touched, tags) is **strictly richer than the diff** —
it tells you *why* the code looks the way it does, which decisions
were considered and rejected, and what the author flagged as a risk
or follow-up.

```
mainline log --json --limit 30
```

Filter by goal/title keywords matching the user's task. For each
relevant hit, pull the full record:

```
mainline show <intent_id> --json
```

Before designing a change, also see what is currently in flight so
your work does not collide with someone else's proposed intent:

```
mainline list-proposals --json
```

`mainline context --json` is a quick agent-consumption snapshot of
the same data (current actor, active intent, recent merged) — useful
for orientation but does not replace the targeted log/show calls.

Use this aggressively. The cost is one or two CLI calls; the payoff
is correct architectural decisions and not duplicating someone's
just-finished work.

### While working

After each meaningful logical change (a feature added, a bug
isolated, a test introduced), record one turn:

```
mainline append "<specific description of what changed>" --json
```

Turns are append-only. Don't try to amend or delete them — describe
the next state in a new turn.

### When the task is complete

1. Commit your code changes the normal way:

   ```
   git add <files> && git commit -m "<message>"
   ```

2. Ask Mainline to prepare a seal package:

   ```
   mainline seal --prepare --json
   ```

3. Generate a `SealResult` JSON matching the schema returned by
   `--prepare`. Populate the fingerprint generously — primary subsystem,
   synonyms, parent concepts, related technologies — so phase-1
   conflict detection has signal:

   ```
   "tags": ["auth", "authentication", "security", "jwt", "session"]
   ```

4. Submit it:

   ```
   mainline seal --submit --json < seal.json
   ```

   Submit auto-syncs with the team and runs phase-1 conflict detection
   against every other proposed/merged intent. If the JSON response
   carries a `conflicts` array, **surface those conflicts to the user
   verbatim** before continuing. Do not silently move on.

### When the user asks you to phase-2 check an intent

Phase 1 is automatic; phase 2 is invoked deliberately when phase 1
flags an overlap (`[check:~]` in `mainline log`) and the user wants a
real semantic judgment.

```
mainline check --prepare --intent <id> --json
```

Read each `judgment_task` in the package, judge whether it is a real
semantic conflict, and submit a `CheckJudgmentResult`:

```
mainline check --submit --json < judgment.json
```

The verdict surfaces in `mainline log`'s `[check:X]` column.

### Optional: agent hooks (opt-in automation)

If `mainline hooks install <agent>` has been run for your agent
runtime (Cursor today; Codex / Claude Code reserved), the hook layer
will automatically invoke mainline at session and turn boundaries:

- `session_start` → `mainline sync` (surfaces any conflicts in stderr).
- `turn_start`    → `mainline start "<goal>"` if no draft exists.
- `turn_end`      → `mainline append "<turn summary>"`.
- `session_end`   → `mainline seal --prepare` (writes `seal.json` for
  you to fill in fingerprint/risks/followups; `seal --submit` is
  still a deliberate human-or-agent action).

Run `mainline hooks status` to confirm whether hooks are wired for
your agent and which auto-flow toggles are enabled. Hooks are a
convenience layer — the contract above (read intents, append turns,
seal honestly) still applies whether they are installed or not.

### What you do NOT need to run

- `mainline sync` — runs automatically inside `seal --submit` and
  whenever a fresh-data command (`check`, `pin`) needs it.
- `mainline pin` — runs automatically after every sync; the strategy
  cascade (tree_hash → commit_hash → goal_text) catches GitHub
  squash-merges with near-100 % reliability.
- `mainline merge` — humans merge via the GitHub PR UI; the next
  `mainline sync` auto-pins the squash commit.

### Do not run unless the user explicitly asks

```
mainline pin <intent> <commit>      # manual fallback
mainline merge --intent <id>        # non-PR pipeline only
mainline init --rewire              # repo setup repair
mainline doctor --setup --fix       # repo setup repair
```

### Encountering an uncovered commit (v0.3 rescue)

If `mainline status` or `mainline gaps` flags an uncovered commit (one
that landed on main with no intent), pick the **best** path you still
can — ordered by reversibility, cheapest first:

1. **Unpushed** — undo and redo via the proper flow:

   ```
   git reset --soft HEAD^         # un-commit, keep changes
   mainline start "<goal>"
   <continue normal flow>
   ```

2. **Pushed** — backfill an intent that retroactively claims the commit:

   ```
   mainline start "<why this commit was made>" --commits <sha>
   mainline append "<turn-by-turn description, post-hoc>"
   mainline seal --prepare > seal.json
   <fill seal.json>
   mainline seal --submit < seal.json
   ```

   The seal flow auto-pins the new intent to the listed commit on next
   `mainline sync`.

3. **Routine** (chore / format / version bump) — mark as deliberately
   skipped:

   ```
   git commit --amend             # add `Mainline-Skip: <reason>` trailer
   ```

   Or add a pattern in `.mainline/config.toml` under `[mainline.skip]`
   so future similar commits classify automatically:

   ```toml
   [mainline.skip]
   patterns = ["^chore: format", "^bump:"]
   ```

4. **Already distributed, regrettably** — accept uncovered. The
   mainline log is a record of reality, not aspiration.

### Seal snapshot contract (v0.3)

`mainline seal --prepare` snapshots the worktree state (HEAD, branch,
clean/dirty/untracked) and persists it. `mainline seal --submit`
validates the live repo against that snapshot — HEAD drift, branch
drift, or dirty worktree all fail by default with a typed error. The
escape hatch is the explicit CLI flag `--allow-dirty`; even then, the
sealed event permanently records `worktree_status` so reviewers see
the audit trail.

Always commit your code BEFORE `mainline seal --prepare`. Untracked
files (planning docs, scratch notes) do **not** enter sealed evidence.
